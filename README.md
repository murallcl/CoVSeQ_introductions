All SOPs generated and used by the CovSeQ consortium are found here: https://c3g.github.io/covseq_McGill/SARS_CoV2_Sequencing/about.html  
and workflows are also described in CoVSeQ's website: https://covseq.ca/methods?lang=en    

*Data availability:*  
Sequences we generated are available in GISAID and VirusSeq Portal and the raw sequence data is available in NCBI under BioProject PRJNA686074. This dataset is also available on our consortiumâ€™s website here: https://covseq.ca/data-info?lang=en.  
Lists of all Quebec and global viral genomes used in this study are available in tables S1 and S2 in the supplementary materials (**link here**).  
We thank all the authors, developers, and contributors to the GISAID database for making their SARS-Cov-2 sequences publicly available.
